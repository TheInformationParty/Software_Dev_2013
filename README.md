# Software_Dev_2013
This is the code base leftover from 2013

As of 3/27/2017 These files have only been uploaded as part of the transition away from storing everything in google docs to a more open enviroment such as GitHub. The files in this repo are everything related to the initial development of the platform discussed in all communication back in 2013. Nothing has been altered nor confirmed in any sort of working order. 

TO DO:
Confirm if any of the code works and is useful or decide to scrap old code and start a fresh plan of attack
List decision and explanation here along with Date for future viewers of this project.
